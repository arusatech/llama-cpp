- All native methods now properly link between Java and C++

## [0.0.8] - 2025-08-30

### Fixed
- **Android Native Library Naming**: Fixed library naming to use `libllama-cpp.so` instead of architecture-specific names
- **Java Library Loading**: Updated CMakeLists.txt to build libraries with generic names for Java compatibility
- **System.loadLibrary() Compatibility**: Java code can now properly load the native library

### Technical
- Changed library target names from `llama-cpp-arm64-v8a` to `llama-cpp` in CMakeLists.txt
- Updated all architecture-specific build configurations to use the same library name
- This ensures `System.loadLibrary("llama-cpp")` can find the correct library file

## [0.0.7] - 2025-08-30

### Fixed
- **Missing CPP Directory**: Added `cpp/` directory to npm package files to fix CMake build errors
- **NPM Package Issue**: The cpp directory containing llama.cpp source files was not included in the published package
- **CMake Build Failure**: Fixed "Cannot find source file" errors when installing plugin as npm dependency

### Technical
- Updated package.json files array to include cpp directory
- This ensures all necessary source files are available when the plugin is installed as a dependency
- CMake build system can now properly locate and compile llama.cpp source files

## [0.0.6] - 2025-08-30

### Fixed
- **CMake Path Issue**: Fixed incorrect relative path in CMakeLists.txt that was causing "Cannot find source file" errors
- **Android Build Success**: Resolved CMake configuration issue and successfully built native library
- **Path Resolution**: Corrected `LLAMACPP_LIB_DIR` from `../../cpp` to `../../../cpp` for proper source file location

### Technical
- Android native library now compiles successfully with correct file paths
- CMake build system properly locates all llama.cpp source files
